# ws
Stupid easy way to start a webserver, which really highlights how lazy I actually am.

# Installation
```bash
python3 setup.py
```

# Usage
```bash
ws
ws <PORT>
```

# Example
```bash
❯ ws
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
^C
Keyboard interrupt received, exiting.
❯ ws 9001
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 9001 (http://0.0.0.0:9001/) ...
```
